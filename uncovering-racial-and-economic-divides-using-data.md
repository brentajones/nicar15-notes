### Detecting racial disparities in your town

— David Herzog

Driven by reaction to Ferguson

News orgs were covering pieces of the story

[NYT: Arrest warrants per capita in Missouri towns](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/24/us/100000003072720.embedded.html?_r=0)[Buzzfeed: Segregation in Ferguson](http://www.buzzfeed.com/jsvine/the-ferguson-area-is-even-more-segregated-than-you-thought)

#### Wanted to look at comprehensive picture

* Law Enforcement
* Economy
* Education
* Segregation

##### Tried to get data at city level

Looked at 22 MO cities:

* At least 10k people
* At least 10% black population

##### Law Enforcement data

* Adult and juvenile arrest rate disparities
* Traffic stop disparities
* Warrants per 10k population
* Percent of total municipal revenue from courts

Turned it into a local TV news story

#### Economy

* Poverty disparity
* Unemployment disparity

#### Segregation

Buzzfeed used dissimilarity index

* Black-white dissimilarity
* Isolation
* Black-white interaction
* Delta

Census bureau on housing patterns

Turned into a story by NPR affiliate with interactive map.

#### Is it class, not race?

Not in Westchester county: [Mapping segregation in Westchester](http://www.propublica.org/article/mapping-segregation-in-westchester)

#### Why are schools segregated?

Where is resegregation happening most?

[Segregation Now](http://www.propublica.org/article/segregation-now-the-resegregation-of-americas-schools)

Finding national trend: Easier said than done. Months of research to write one graf.

##### Making their own data

[School Segregation After Brown](projects.propublica.org/segregaion-now/)

Displayed data and created database for others to use.

[School districts didn't know whether they had been under an order or not](http://www.propublica.org/article/lack-of-order-the-erosion-of-a-once-great-force-for-integration)(!)

#### Truth-squadding

Testing assumptions

"Racism gets reduced to intent, as if intent is all that matters." — David J. Leonard

Racial inequality is not an accident or simply a legacy of the past.
