### Procurement database

All spending

Can use to find purchase orders, then FOIA those

### Time/expectations management

Batch tasks

Do small tasks to fill in time (file FOIA while waiting for callbacks)

Keep lists of stories to do: one list of short-turnarounds, one list of bigger projects

Estimate time accurately (e.g. overestimate time)

Make sure it's a story before you say it's a story

### Etc.

Hoard data.

#### How do you know what data is available?

Talk to companies that specialize in analytics of your industry.

Records retention schedule

#### Using data in unconventional way?

Roadkill database

WSJ BLS and Census data to find locations that might be good places to cover specific stories

#### What's good data for finding out about relationships between health systems and cities

Stuff one arm of government sends to another.

Hospital Cost Report

#### BLS publishes data down to county level, has subject-matter experts, regional press offices

"Let yourself fall down the rabbit hole". Go to a federal agency and see what's available.

Request city cellphone numbers and who's assigned to them.

#### Tools for using data in your newsroom

Monitor websites: Change detection, [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts)

[PANDA project](http://pandaproject.net/)

[Tabula](http://www.tabula.com/)

[CometDocs](http://www.cometdocs.com/) ([get it from IRE, for members](http://www.ire.org/blog/ire-news/2013/05/22/ire-announces-partnership-cometdocs/))

#### How do you find stories in routine data

Dataset of claims against the city for damages from vehicles

EPA spills database

Deer hunting data: Most prolific deer hunters in the state

#### Difference between data reporting and beat reporting

Part of data reporting is evangelizing to beat reporters. Having to let go of old beat.

#### How can you help other reporters?

Run interference on other people who want reporters to do more work.

Let beat reporters know data exists. Monitor budgets. "If you ever want to do something like that, I can help."

"Being super-available."

Swoop in and ask for data.
