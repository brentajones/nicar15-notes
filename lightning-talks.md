## The end of maps, in 7 charts

Maps tend to show population density.

Seven solutions for maps that don't tell stories.

#### Lack of context

Solution: Population squares

#### Hidden info

Solution:  List or table

#### Too much data

Small multiples

#### National population maps

Use other data points

#### Wrong data display

Map as navigation and/or put a face on it

#### Too many categories

Table or list

#### Data isn't geographic

Streamgraphs!

Don't assume that since it's geographic data it must be explained on a map.

How designers and developers can work together

#### Hit & run
Designers: "Here's a comp. Work your magic!"

#### Frontloading creativity
Dream big early, feature requests early, edit later.

#### Because I said so

I know code vs. I know design. Compromise or convince.

#### Thinking magical
"Whip this up"

"Can't you just"

#### Lazy CSS
Programmer: "It's close enough"
Designer: "Argh"

#### Speaking each other's love language
Programmers paying attention to details, designers learning how to talk code

#### Hierarchy of features
Priorities and motivations

#### Gotcha
Iterate: You have to.

#### Please and thank you

## Stop trying to multitask. You’re terrible at it.
[Chris Canipe WSJ](http://chriscanipe.com/)

Programming's art. Requires critical thinking. Building elaborate machines every day. And constantly being interrupted.

When we split time, we lose time. Losses to context switching.

Attention is a finite resource.

Your time is **your** time. Protect it. Build walls.

Do tasks in order, don't switch between them.

Don't be like me.

## The Five Stages of Terrible Data: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance
[Steven Rich WaPo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/steven-rich)

[Slides](http://slides.com/stevenrich/yourdataisprobablybad#/)


Using data *because* it exists is like eating the cleanest food in the trash can.

Bad data looks like good data

Missing data
missing fields
produced by companies
field defs. fuzzy
dirty

can't always blame the data

Understand:
how it was collected
why it was collected
every column
purpose

two types of bad data

bad data: Can use if can clean
irredemably bad data: nope.

#### Denial
Can't be that bad

#### Anger
Isn't that bad!

#### Bargaining
What if it isn't that bad

#### Depression
It's bad and I feel bad

#### Acceptance
It's bad and I'll move past it.

If you don't get through the stages, everyone suffers.

#### How can we stop it?

Slow. Down. Can't always do it today.

Pick up the phone.

Try to poke holes in it.

Help your neighbor. Friends don't let friends use bad data.

Bad data leads to bad stories.

Bad stories lead to bad policies.

Bad policies lead to bad outcomes.

KNOW THY DATA.

## What do blind people see? A thought-talk about our obsession with visuals and how it translates for the blind
[Suyeon Son](https://twitter.com/suymilk)

[Slides](http://suyeon-son.com/presentations/nicar2015-lt/#/)

Let's get uncomfortable.

What you see is not what I see.

Perception != Sensation

By abstraction. Associate visuals with other senses.

By touch.

By taste.

By sound.

## Stop letting the cool factor detract from your journalism

[Ashlyn Still AJC](http://www.ajc.com/staff/ashlyn-still/)

[Slides](http://ashlynstill.github.io/lightningtalk_ashlyn.pdf)

We get too distracted by new and exciting.

The Snowfall effect: Only works if it enhances the story.

Our job isn't to make incredible things on the web, it's to tell incredible stories on the web.

Every story doesn't need a cool interactive. Don't force visuals for the sake of visuals.

Reporters: Talk early and often to data viz folks. Data Viz folks: Talk to reporters.

Look at why you love cool stories, not just why they're cool.

Don't say no to cool things just because they're cool things.
